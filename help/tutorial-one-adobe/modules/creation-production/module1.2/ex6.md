# 1.2.6 Frame I/O to Workfront Fusion to AEM Assets

In the previous exercise you configured a scenario that automatically generates variations of an Adobe Photoshop PSD file using Adobe Firefly. The output of that scenario was a new Photoshop PSD file. The business teams however don&#39;t need a PSD file, they need a PNG file or a JPG file. In this exercise, you&#39;ll configure a new automation that will result in a PNG file being generated once the asset in Frame I/O is approved, and that PNG file will be stored in AEM Assets automatically.
